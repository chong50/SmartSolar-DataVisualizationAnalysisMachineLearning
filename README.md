# Smart Solar - Supervisory Data Acquisition, Visualization, Optimization, Analysis
## Data Modeling and Analysis
This repository showcases the full progress report, evidence and results of data modeling and analysis software code in .m file using MATLAB software to feature progress as of now.

Inside the repository folder features a MATLAB .m file of the code in progress, graph visualization, sample data, and lastly this README.md.

Note: Due to the rest of incomplete subsystems, we are unable to import real data from remote server. In our testing of code function, we created a sample data .csv to make sure our code segments work right in the absence of real data. 

The sample data includes the respective power consumption data of each tenant in Wang Hall. In the absence of real data,  we made the comparison of useful analogy of each subsystem's power consumption to each tenant consumption in the building, and the total of whole system to the building system of Wang Hall. 

## Features (System Environment)
In features, we simplify the code by breaking down the code infrastructure in .m files into each section corresponding to its process and function. 
- Importing the Data
- Visualization of Data
- Computation of Generation and Load Consumption Graphs
- Normalizing Input data and Transforming Outputs 
- Process of Artificial Neural Network 
- Model Visualization and Computation of Error

## Objective 
The objective of the code is to first import the data from remote server. Visualize them. Normalizing input and output. Feed into Machine Learning. The process of Machine Learning include re-training the model and finding the optimal number of neurons. Finally, based on optimal results, we can infer and predict the results of future performance of Power generation of the solar panel.
