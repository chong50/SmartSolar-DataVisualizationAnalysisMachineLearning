# Smart Solar - Data Visualization, Optimization, Analysis
## Data Modeling and Analysis
This repository showcases the full progress report on strategy, planning, implementation, evidence and results of analysis software code infrastructure in .m file, in order to enable visualization of data to obtain insights, and process of Machine Learning (by artificial Neural Network) to infer, predict current and future performance of power generation of solar panel in the Project. On Progress Report, to current extent MATLAB coding is exclusive. Due to the unfinished installation of the hardware system under working progress, we create our dummy data set to mimic 
## Activity Diagram

## Features (System Environment)
In features, we simplify the code by breaking down the code infrastructure in .m files into each section corresponding to its process and function. 
- Importing the Data
- Visualization of Data
- Computation of Generation and Load Consumption Graphs
- Normalizing Input data and Transforming Outputs 
- Process of Artificial Neural Network 
- Model Visualization and Computation of Error
