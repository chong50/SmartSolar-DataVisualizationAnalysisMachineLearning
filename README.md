# Smart Solar - Supervisory Data Acquisition, Visualization, Optimization, Analysis
## Data Modeling and Analysis
#### This repository showcases the full progress report, evidence and results of data modeling and analysis software code in .m file using MATLAB software to feature progress as of now.

Inside the repository folder features a MATLAB .m file of the code in progress, graph visualization, sample data, and lastly this README.md.

## Features (System Environment)
In features, we simplify the code by breaking down the code infrastructure in .m files into each section corresponding to its process and function. 
- Importing the Data
- Visualization of Data
- Computation of Generation and Load Consumption Graphs
- Normalizing Input data and Transforming Outputs 
- Process of Artificial Neural Network 
- Model Visualization and Computation of Error

## Objective 
The objective of the code is to first import the data from remote server. Visualize them. Normalizing input and output. Feed into Machine Learning. The process of Machine Learning include re-training the model and finding the optimal number of neurons. Finally, based on optimal results, we can infer and predict the results of future performance of Power generation of the solar panel.
