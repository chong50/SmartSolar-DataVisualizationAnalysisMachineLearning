# Smart Solar - Data Visualization, Optimization, Analysis
## Data Modeling and Analysis
#### This repository showcases the full progress report, evidence and results of data modeling and analysis software code in .m file using MATLAB software to feature progress as of now.

#### Inside the repository folder has MATLAB .m file featuring the software code in progress, results of graphs, a sample data file, and also this README.md file.

The objective of the code is to first import the data from remote server, and enable visualization of data to obtain insights, then visit the process of Machine Learning (by artificial Neural Network) using same input data to infer, predict current and future performances of power generation of solar panel in Smart Solar Project.


## Activity Diagram

## Features (System Environment)
In features, we simplify the code by breaking down the code infrastructure in .m files into each section corresponding to its process and function. 
- Importing the Data
- Visualization of Data
- Computation of Generation and Load Consumption Graphs
- Normalizing Input data and Transforming Outputs 
- Process of Artificial Neural Network 
- Model Visualization and Computation of Error
